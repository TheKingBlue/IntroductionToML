    "In this assignment, you will implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, as discussed in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with the `COIL20.mat` dataset on Themis. The dataset consists of 1440 images, where each image has a size of $32 \\times 32$ pixels and is flattened into a vector of length 1024. All images are stored in one matrix of size $1440 \\times 1024$, where each row represents one image and each column corresponds to a pixel. The images come from 20 different objects, and each object is recorded at 72 different rotation angles, with a rotation step of 5 degrees."

    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a linear method of feature extraction for unsupervised machine learning.\n",
    "The goal is to find a new set of dimensions that are the combinations of the original dimensions.\n",
    "This is done by mapping data points from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space while minimizing information loss.\n",
    "The steps of PCA are:\n",
    "1. Standardize the data set.\n",
    "2. Compute the principal components:\n",
    "    - Compute the co-variance matrix.\n",
    "    - Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
    "3. Choose reduced dimensionality *d*.\n",
    "4. Only pick the first *d* eigenvectors, where the eigenvectors are the principal components.  \n",
    "In general, the i-th eigenvector of the covariance matrix is associated to the i-th eigenvalue.\n"
